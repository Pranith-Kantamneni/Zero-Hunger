        <h1>Crisis Affected Countries</h1>
    
        <div class="country">
            <h2>South Sudan</h2>
            <p> South Sudan has faced severe food insecurity primarily due to ongoing conflict, displacement of populations, economic challenges, and environmental factors. Here are some key issues affecting food security in South Sudan:</p>

        <h3>Conflict and Displacement:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impact on Agriculture:</strong> The prolonged conflict has disrupted agricultural activities, including planting, harvesting, and livestock management. Many farmers have been unable to cultivate their lands due to insecurity and displacement.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
            <li><strong>Displacement and Vulnerability:</strong> Over 2 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan, and millions more have sought refuge in neighboring countries. Displaced populations often lack access to farmland, food sources, and livelihood opportunities, exacerbating their vulnerability to food insecurity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hyperinflation:</strong> South Sudan has experienced hyperinflation, leading to skyrocketing food prices. This has made food unaffordable for many families, even when food is available in local markets.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
            <li><strong>Economic Collapse:</strong> The overall economic collapse has reduced incomes and livelihood opportunities, pushing more people into poverty and food insecurity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Climate and Environmental Factors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Droughts and Floods:</strong> South Sudan is vulnerable to climate extremes, including droughts and floods, which can devastate crops and agricultural productivity. Erratic rainfall patterns further exacerbate food insecurity, affecting both rural and urban populations.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
            <li><strong>Environmental Degradation:</strong> Deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity contribute to reduced agricultural yields and limited access to natural resources essential for food production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Humanitarian Access and Aid Dependency:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Insecurity and logistical challenges often restrict humanitarian organizations' access to vulnerable populations, hindering the delivery of food assistance and other humanitarian aid.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
            <li><strong>Dependency on Aid:</strong> Millions of South Sudanese rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. The disruption of aid delivery or insufficient funding can exacerbate food insecurity crises.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nutrition and Health Impacts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> Food insecurity contributes to high rates of malnutrition, particularly among children under five and pregnant or lactating women. Malnutrition weakens immune systems and increases susceptibility to diseases, further threatening lives in already precarious situations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Livelihood and Food Production Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Livelihood Destruction:</strong> Destruction of infrastructure, markets, and livestock during conflict disrupts livelihoods and undermines local food production capacity.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
            <li><strong>Limited Agricultural Inputs:</strong> Farmers lack access to seeds, tools, and irrigation, which are essential for sustainable agriculture and improving food security in the long term.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Yemen</h2>
            <div class="country-details">

    <p>Yemen has been devastated by ongoing conflict since 2014, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. The conflict has directly contributed to food insecurity through its impact on agriculture, markets, and livelihoods.</p>

    <h3>Economic Collapse and Currency Devaluation</h3>
    <p>The Yemeni economy has collapsed amidst the conflict, exacerbated by currency devaluation and hyperinflation. This economic instability has made food unaffordable for many Yemeni families.</p>

    <h3>Famine and Severe Food Shortages</h3>
    <p>Parts of Yemen have experienced famine conditions, with millions facing severe food shortages. Access to food has been severely restricted due to conflict-related disruptions and economic challenges.</p>

    <h3>Impact on Nutrition and Health</h3>
    <p>Malnutrition rates are alarmingly high in Yemen, particularly among children and pregnant women. Chronic malnutrition weakens immune systems and increases susceptibility to diseases, leading to higher mortality rates.</p>

    <h3>Humanitarian Aid and Access Challenges</h3>
    <p>Humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering aid to affected populations due to ongoing conflict, logistical constraints, and access limitations. The insecurity hampers efforts to reach vulnerable communities in need of food assistance.</p>

    <h3>International Response and Support</h3>
    <p>The international community has provided humanitarian aid to Yemen, but funding remains insufficient to meet the overwhelming needs. International cooperation is crucial in addressing the root causes of Yemen's hunger crisis and supporting sustainable solutions.</p>

            <h2>Venezuela</h2>
            <div class="country-details">
              <p>Venezuela has been facing a severe hunger crisis , exacerbated by a combination of economic collapse, political instability, and social upheaval.Here are Some Key Issues of Venezuela regarding the Hunger Crisis in Thier Country:
            <h3>Economic Collapse and Hyperinflation</h3>
            <p>Venezuela's economy has collapsed, marked by hyperinflation that has rendered basic goods unaffordable. This economic instability has severely disrupted food production, distribution, and access across the country.</p>

            <h3>Food Shortages and Distribution Challenges</h3>
            <p>The collapse of Venezuela's economy has led to widespread shortages of essential food items such as grains, meat, and dairy products. Distribution systems have been strained, making it difficult for citizens to access sufficient and nutritious food.</p>

            <h3>Impact on Nutrition and Health</h3>
            <p>The scarcity of food and inadequate nutrition have caused a nutrition crisis in Venezuela. Malnutrition rates, especially among children and vulnerable populations, have risen significantly. This has led to an increase in malnutrition-related illnesses and weakened immune systems.</p>

            <h3>Social and Political Factors</h3>
            <p>Political instability and social unrest have exacerbated the hunger crisis. Civil unrest and government policies have further hindered food distribution and access, exacerbating the challenges faced by Venezuelans.</p>

            <h3>Long-term Solutions and International Support</h3>
            <p>Addressing Venezuela's hunger crisis requires both immediate humanitarian aid and sustainable, long-term solutions. These solutions should focus on economic recovery, improving food security, and fostering social stability. International cooperation and support are essential for implementing effective measures to alleviate food insecurity and improve the lives of Venezuelans.</p>
