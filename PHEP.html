            <h1>Permanent Hunger Eradication Program (PHEP)</h1>
            <p>Removing a problem from society and cutting a tree is almost the same; the only difference is that cutting a tree is harmful to society, but cutting out a problem helps society in further growth. If a tree is just cut above the ground and the roots are left, the tree grows back in a few days or months. In the same way, trying to eradicate a problem just by helping the affected doesn't eradicate the problem completely; it always tends to grow back. That is why we are going to eradicate the problem from the root. We are working to provide education or help in skill development for people who are now starving. Donate and help us in our mission to eradicate hunger from its roots. The names of the people we helped in this way and their progress will be updated to you by our team regularly.</p>
